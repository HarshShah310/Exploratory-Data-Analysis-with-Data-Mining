# Exploratory Data Analysis with Data Mining

● In this project, I embarked on a captivating journey into the realm of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) while harnessing the power of Python, R, and Weka. The project revolved around the application of various data mining techniques, including classification, natural language processing (NLP), association rule mining, and clustering, to extract insights and patterns from complex datasets.

● Throughout the project, I meticulously followed the data mining process, from data preprocessing to algorithm implementation, evaluation, and result interpretation. By successfully executing these tasks, I honed my skills in data manipulation, algorithm selection, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
